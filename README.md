# phone-numers-cleaner

Clean Mexican phone numbers by deleting prefixes 01, 044, 045 and digit 1 from +521. 

All you need as input is a .csv file imported from Google Contacts. 

The code area is required. Phone numbers with 8 digits or less cannot be modified because they could be from Mexico City, Guadalajara or Monterrey.   
E.g. 56581111 cannot be modified to 5556581111
